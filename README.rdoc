== How to ride the rails to babylonia
Feels like babylonia, validates like rails

   class BabylonianFields < ActiveRecord::Base
     build_babylonian_tower_on :grass
     
     validate :grass, languages: {present: [:en, :de, :it], length: 2..1000}
   end
   
   I18n.locale #=> :en, so it will set en
   
   babylonian_field = BabylonianFields.new grass: 'Hello'
  
   babylonian_field.valid? #=> false
   babylonian_field.errors.full_messages #=> "Grass should also be translated in DE and IT"
   babylonian_field.grass = {de: 'DEUTSCH', it: 'I'}
   babylonian_field.valid? #=> false
   babylonian_field.errors.full_messages #=> "Grass should be between 2 an 1000 characters in IT"
   babylonian_field.grass = {it: 'IT'}
   babylonian_field.valid? #=> true

* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
